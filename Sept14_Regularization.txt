problem statement -- find out the price of an apartment in a particular city.

Eg: Delhi
5 areas in Delhi - a,b,c,d,e
2 & 3 bhk

Dataset :
area name , 2/3 bhk , sqft., balcony , car parking , builder's name ,
no. of bathrooms, presence of pine trees within the apartment premises,
house price

house price - target/ dependent variable , 
all other columns - features/ independent variables

Correlation :

it tells how 2 variables are related

correlation value range -> (-1,1)

Types : Positive , Negative correlation 

Positive correlation :

==>Direct variation between 2 columns (i.e) when the value of one column
increases/ decreases , the value of the other also increases/decreases resp
(features)
house price , 2/3 bhk , sqft.

regression equation for the above scenario:
y(house price) = b1(2/3 bhk or no.of bedrooms) + b2(sqft) + c

b1 -- strength of relationship between the no.of bedrooms column and the 
      house price column

Negative correlation :


Indirect variation  => When the value of one column increases , the other 
                       value of the other column decreases. (features)


Correlation value range (-1, +1) 

strong +ve correlation values = 0.8, 0.9 , 1 

strong -ve correlation values = -0.8,-0.9, -1

Correlation can be assessed only for numeric values.
