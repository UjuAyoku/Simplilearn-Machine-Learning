
User based Collaborative Filtering : In this model, the products are 
recommended to a particular user based on the fact that the products have been
liked by users who have similar interests as the user to whom the product is
intended to be recommended.


Item based CF : These are systems that identify similar items based on the 
ratings given by multiple users previously for those items.

For eg: Let's say that 3 customers A, B & C have given a  5 star rating for 
2 books - X & Y. Now, a new customer D buys the book Y. 
Now, in an Item Based CF system, the book X will also be recommended to 
user D because both the books X & Y have similar ratings.
