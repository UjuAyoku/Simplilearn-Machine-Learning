problem statement -- find out the price of an apartment in a particular city.

Eg: Delhi 


5 areas in Delhi - a,b,c,d,e

2 & 3 bhk 

area name , 2/3 bhk , sqft., balcony , car parking , builder's name ,
no. of bathrooms, presence of pine trees within the apartment premises 
--> factors which affect the price of the apartment
---> features 

actual price of the house --> output/ outcome --> target variable --> label


Supervised learning :

labelled historic data 

2 types : Regression & classification 


Regression : When the output variable / label is of continuous numeric type

Eg: Prediction of house prices , prediction of stock prices, predict the 
    height of a person , predict the salary of a person

Algorithms:

Simple Linear , Multiple Linear , Polynomial Regression

Classification : When the output variable / label is of categorical type

Eg: a transaction is fraudulent or not (2), identify the grades of a student (6),
    whether a person is diabetic or not(2), spam/ham email classification(2)
    classify a trip as long/medium/short distance (3), movie ratings 1 to 5 (5)

Algorithms: 

Logistic regression , decision trees, support vector machines etc.,
           
=============================================================================
Machine learning model building steps:

1. import the right kind of data according to the problem statement

2. explore your data  & visualize your data to gain insights about the data.

3. relationship between the features and the target should be figured out.

4. encode all the necessary categorical variables present in the dataset

5. Identify the target variable. And , you have to split the data into 
X (features) and y(target)

6. splitting the original dataset into train set & test set = 80 :20

1000 data points - original dataset

training - 800 data points 
testing - 200 data points

7. build your machine learning model with the training dataset (features, target)

8. test your model with the features of the test dataset and observe the predicted
output. And, u have to compare the predicted output and the actual target of the
test dataset.

9. evaluation metrics for regression & classification

quantitative variables    |   qualitative variables

- continuous                   - categorical   --- nominal, ordinal & binary
- discrete                     - nominal -- male , female , transgender 
Eg:no.of houses, population|   - binary -- true / false 
                               - ordinal -- tall , medium , short 
                                           tall > medium > short 


                               - movie ratings/ book ratings --> 1 to 5
==============================================================================

Regression:

  y  = mx +c 

m - regression co-efficient which expresses the strength of relationship 
between the feature and the target 

y - target

x - feature 

simple linear regression:

y = mx+c 

when u have one target variable and only one feature, it is called SLR

Multiple linear regression :

  y = b1x1 + b2x2 + b3x3 + ... + bnxn + c

b1, b2, b3 ... bn - regression co-efficients which express the strength of
relationship between x1,x2,x3 ...xn respectively with y.

x1 - sqft , y - proce of the house ==> b1 - tells about the strength of 
relationship between x1 and y.

x2 - no od bedrooms ==> b2 - tell about the strength of relationship between
x2 and y.


Evaluation : RMSE

root mean squared error 

the diff between the predicted values and the actual values 


actual =  25 
predicted = 21

pred - actual = -4   = 16

actual = 31
predicted = 32

pred - actual = 1  =1 

total error = 16 + 1 / 2 = 8.5 --> root of 8.5 --> final RMSE value
